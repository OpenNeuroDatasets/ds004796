### Description of the database:

Full cohort: 192 healthy middle-aged (50-63) individuals, balanced female and male ratio. 

* Genetic data (N = 192):
	* Apolipoprotein E (APOE)

* Basic demographic and health data
* Psychometric data (memory, intelligence, mood, personality, stress coping strategies)

Cohort subgroup: 79 healthy middle-aged (50-63) individuals, balanced female and male ratio.

* Neuroimaging data:
	* Functional data — electroencefalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI):
		* Resting-state protocol (with two conditions: eyes open and eyes closed) 
		* Cognitive tasks: multi-source interference task (MSIT) and Sternberg’s memory task
* Blood tests data (blood count, lipid profile, HSV virus)
