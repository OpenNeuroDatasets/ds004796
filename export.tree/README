### Description of the database:

Full cohort: 192 healthy middle-aged (50-63) individuals, balanced female and male ratio. 

* Genetic data (N = 192):
	* Apolipoprotein E (APOE) 
	* Phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM)
* Basic demographic and health data
* Psychometric data (memory, intelligence, mood, personality, stress coping strategies)

Cohort subgroup: 79 healthy middle-aged (50-63) individuals, balanced female and male ratio.

* Neuroimaging data:
	* Functional data — electroencefalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI):
		* Resting-state protocol (with two conditions: eyes open and eyes closed) 
		* Cognitive tasks: multi-source interference task (MSIT) and Sternberg’s memory task
* Blood tests data (blood count, lipid profile, HSV virus)

### Additional data:
* Structural MRI data are protected and available upon request
	* MRI experiments were conducted using a Siemens Prisma FIT 3T scanner (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 64-channel phased-array RF head coil. Structural images were acquired with the following parameters: a repetition time (TR) of 2400 ms, an inversion time (TI) of 1000 ms, an echo time (TE) of 2.74 ms, a flip angle of 8 degrees, a field of view (FOV) of 256x256 mm, and a voxel size of 0.8x0.8x0.8 mm. The total acquisition time (TA) for T1-weighted images was 6 minutes and 52 seconds. All MRI files underwent "defacing" using the fsl_deface algorithm (FSL 6.0.6.4 software on Ubuntu).
